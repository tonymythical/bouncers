# Bouncers
An exercise to learn about functions and classes.

Please find instructions in [instructions.md](instructions.md).

This is a simple demonstration presenting sprites bouncing off the sides of a GBA screen with random generation via spawn location and the flashing effect.

The sprite design was changed to represent a star and accomplish a 'shooting star' concept.

Here is a link to the GBA test: [GitHub Pages](https://tonymythical.github.io/bouncers/).
